# MTG tooltip JS

A simple vanilla javascript plugin to create images tooltips for magic the gathering cards. No dependencies, no extra css, just a .js file and little bit of html.

You can check it working live here, along with some examples of usage and a "nicier" page :)

What advantages do i have over ([Inline mtg](https://gist.github.com/NickolasReynolds/9306194) - my inspiration/basepoint) the previous one?

* No libraries needed
* lazyload tooltip images
* Size
* Select defaults sets for shocklands, painlands, fetchlands, and basics (more can be added, make a pull request or ask me)
* option to now load/start on mobile (you don't have a mouse to mover over the images/name, do you?)
* option to remove elements created and events added.
